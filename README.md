# postfix
CMP344 Phil Hofer Ch.4 Infix-Postfix

This postfix calculator uses d8 as its interpreter.

Currently, this calculator does not handle spaces. This means that 
expressions entered in should not be separated by spaces.

There's also a bug that I haven't fully tracked down that occurs 
when handling relatively complex expressions. As far as I understand 
it, simple expressions can be handled perfectly fine.
